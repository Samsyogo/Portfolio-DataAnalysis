# About me
Hi, I'm Oyogo, a data analyst and front-end developer with two years of experience in website development and data analysis. I am excellent at turning numbers into insights to determine the best direction for the business while creating attractive and practical web solutions. As a Data Analyst at heart and profession, I extract information, value, and understanding from data and develop leading visuals for decision-making.

## Data Analysis
Programming languages: Python -libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib ), and SQL(MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI, SPSS, STATA, and MS Excel 

Skills: Data exploration, cleaning data, statistics, Data visualization, and correlation matrices
## Frontend Developer
Programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks: React, Bootstrap, and Spring Boot

Responsive Web Design, web hosting

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases

### Titanic Machine learning from disaster
**Code:** [`titanic.ipynb`](https://github.com/Samsyogo/Data-Project1/blob/main/Titanic%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster/titanic.ipynb)

**Goal:** The goal is to build a predictive model that, based on these features, can classify which passengers are likely to survive and which are not. The project helps develop skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation.

**Description:** The objective of the Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. This project provides participants with a dataset containing information about passengers: age, sex, class, and other factors. The project helps develop skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

 

### Predicting income level based on an individual's personal information
**Goal:** This machine learning project aims to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year or not, given their demographic variation.

**Code:** [`adult-income.ipynb`](https://github.com/Samsyogo/predicting-income-level-based-on-the-individual-s-personal-information)

**Description:** This machine learning project aims to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year, given their demographic variation. Several classification techniques are explored to achieve this, and the random forest model yields the best prediction result.
**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** There is a positive correlation between working hours and income, and there is a strong relationship between education level and income. 
     Age and work experience are important factors affecting income level.
In the light of this data:
 -It can be used in career counseling services for Income forecasting.
 -It can be used in salary-setting policies for HR departments.
 -It can be used as a reference in companies' recruitment processes.
Proposed ML Models:
 -XGBoost.
 -Gradient Boosting Classifier.
 -Random Forest Classifier.
These models are appropriate for this problem with their ability to handle categorical and numerical variables together.
to capture non-linear relationships and to show high performance.

## Ecommerce purchases analysis project to monitor customers' behavior
**Goal** To monitor customers' purchase behavior.

**Code:** [`Ecommerce.ipynb`](https://github.com/Samsyogo/Ecommerce-purchases-analysis-project-to-monitor-customers--behavior/blob/main/Ecommerce.ipynb)

**Description:** This project aims to monitor customers' behavior during purchase.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.
