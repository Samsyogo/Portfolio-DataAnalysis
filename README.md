# About me
A Data Analyst by heart and profession, I extract information, value, and understanding from data and create leading visuals for decision-making. More practically, I have hands-on experience working on statistics, cleaning data, and machine learning. I love turning raw data into interesting information. I apply programming languages like Python and SQL and tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Excel to create value for organizations.
The projects available in the portfolio include looking at real business datasets in various industries, including e-commerce, finance, healthcare, and marketing. I also have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and am always looking for something new to engage with in data analytics.

I have created this repository to showcase skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics
